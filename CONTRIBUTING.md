# Contributing

First of all, we want to thank you for being willing to contribute to this project.


## The most important part

Before quality code, we mainly want a friendly environment. **PLEASE RESPECT** each person you might interact with, whether it's their first issue on GitHub or their thousandth pull request.

Having a negative attitude leads to a stressful time, and we have so much in our lives we don't have time to care about being harassed online.


## The technical part

Here are the main directives to follow when contributing:

- Discuss what you want to do with others before going all-in.
- Fork the repository, and work on a new branch. Branch from `dev` if it exists, else `master`.
- Leave a writing trace of what you've done. Either in the form of code comments, or as text in commits.
- Try to keep consistency in the codebase. Style is not that important, visual consistency is.
- Comment your code. We're all too busy for comments, but they really are important.
- Have fun developing new features! It really means to us.
- If tests exist, don't forget to run and fix them before marking your pull request as ready.
- Write your commit message in the present tense. You should read your commit as: "When applied, this commit will" + your commit message. An example might be: "when applied, this commit will fix the user getting kicked problem".
- If your PR is linked to an existing issue please add a reference to it in the PR and close it after the PR is merged.

##### Mandatory steps!
Before marking your PR as ready to be merged, you must run the `yarn lint` and `yarn test` scripts. It limits regression and help keep the style consistent (and sometimes assure better commit diffs).

### And one last thing

Always always always go for your self-accomplishment. No code is worth getting disgusted of life for.
We will be happy to count you as a contributor, but you should never feel obliged to.

On this note, **happy coding!**
